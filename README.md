# Sample Android Project

This repository provides everything you need to start a modern, scalable, and robust Android project. Skip the initial setup and boilerplate code, and quickly dive into development with this well-organized template.

## Key Features

This Android project template is built using the following technologies and design patterns:

- **Jetpack Compose** – A modern UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces
- **MVVM** – Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern
- **Clean Architecture** – Separation of code into distinct layers for clear responsibility
- **Modularization** – Dividing the project into independent feature-based modules
- **Hilt** – Dependency injection for managing app dependencies
- **Coroutines and Flow** – Asynchronous programming and structured concurrency
- **Retrofit** – REST client for network communication
- **Gson** – JSON parsing and serialization/deserialization
- **Navigation Component** – In-app navigation management with flexible navigation graphs
- **Data Store** – Efficient data storage solution, replacing SharedPreferences
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** – For sending notifications
- **Coil** – A Kotlin-first image loading library
- **Dark Theme** – Support for both light and dark modes
- **Multi-language support** – Internationalization for a global audience

## Project Structure

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles and organizes the code into various layers and modules:

- **app**: Contains the main Android application module.
- **data**: Implements the data layer, including repositories, data sources, and models.
- **domain**: Defines the business logic layer, including use cases.
- **model**: Responsible for the data models and domain logic shared across layers.
- **feature**: Each module under this section corresponds to a specific feature, containing related UI, logic, and data handling components.
- **database**: Handles local database operations, utilizing Room Database for efficient local data management.
- **network**: Manages network operations and API calls, using Retrofit for communication and Gson for data parsing.
- **common**: Includes shared utilities, extensions, and reusable code components that are frequently used across the project.
- **design system**: Includes reusable design components and styles to maintain a modular and cohesive UI across the app.

## Dependency Injection

We use **Hilt** for dependency injection, ensuring a scalable, modular, and testable architecture. Hilt simplifies the injection process and automatically manages the lifecycle of dependencies.

## Asynchronous Programming

This project leverages **Coroutines** and **Flow** for asynchronous programming. Coroutines provide structured concurrency and allow developers to write cleaner, more readable code that handles asynchronous operations in a sequential style.

## Network Communication

For network operations, we use **Retrofit**, which offers a scalable and efficient way to interact with RESTful APIs. Combined with **Gson** for JSON processing, it ensures reliable serialization and deserialization of data.
